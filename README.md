# Forecasting System

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive forecasting system designed to predict future sales of products in a retail store using the ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) model. The system leverages historical sales data and advanced statistical techniques to provide accurate and reliable forecasts.

## Features

- **ARIMA Model Implementation**: Utilizes the ARIMA model to forecast future sales based on historical data.
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyzes past sales trends to inform and improve future predictions.
- **Precision Forecasting**: Provides precise sales forecasts to assist in inventory management, sales strategy, and financial planning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - statsmodels
  - matplotlib

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-forecasting-system.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd project-forecasting-system
    ```

3. Install the required libraries:
    ```sh
    pip install pandas numpy statsmodels matplotlib
    ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your historical sales data in a CSV file. Ensure the file includes at least two columns: 'date' and 'sales'.

2. Modify the configuration file (if applicable) to point to your data file and adjust any parameters as needed.

3. Run the forecasting script:
    ```sh
    python forecast.py
    ```

4. View the output, which includes sales forecasts and visualizations of the historical data and predictions.

### Example

Here is an example of how to use the system:

1. Place your historical sales data in a file named `sales_data.csv`.

2. Run the script:
    ```sh
    python forecast.py --data sales_data.csv
    ```

3. The script will output forecasted sales and generate visualizations for better understanding and analysis.
